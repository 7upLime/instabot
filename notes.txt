Instagram allows max 40 follows per hour
never really waited one entire hour to verify if 'daiy_follow_loop' actually works till the end
But conceptually... should work.. if screen's not going idle, or connection closes, or...

A small profile doesn't really have much to do..
I thinked about following random people and like/comment stranger's posts

Actually running out of ideas...
